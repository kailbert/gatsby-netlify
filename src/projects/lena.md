After having already shot some projects for Jolie Magazine in Munich we went back to shoot Lena Meyer-Landrut for L'Oreal Paris. The amazing Nina Park did the make-up and Sigi Kumpfmüller was responsible for her hair. We knew Lena only from her career as a singer but she was also one of the most professional models we have ever worked with. Always in a good mood, she did a perfect job.
