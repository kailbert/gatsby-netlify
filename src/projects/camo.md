ARKK Copenhagen is THE Nordic Sneaker brand. Why not take a step in a new landscape away from the cold north with sneakers of the Camo Pack. There is no better place to present these great shoes than in a desert-like environment. This awesome shooting was rounded off with Moritz Staub’s usual sound magic and a little taste of Joel Rieger’s animation skills.
