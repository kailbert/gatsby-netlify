Together with the agency „Kreativrudel“ I had the pleasure to produce this TVC for the Show: „Das Ding des Jahres“ shown during prime time on ProSieben, one of the biggest German TV-Stations. 
Ridetronic takes agility to a new level. This e-bike does not take any compromises. It combines the advantages like costs, weight and style of a normal bike with the conveniences of an e-bike. I followed three totally different characters through their everyday life in a busy city. With the help of this bike they are everywhere fast in style without harming the environment.
